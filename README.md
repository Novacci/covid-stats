## Description & Screenshots

Application has been created with help of modern web-development tools like: React, SCSS, Typescript and Material UI. Thanks to all of that it provides great user 
experience, so that data can be seen clearly with ability of sorting and filtering.
The project has two available themes: dark and light.
Light Mode (default):

Filtering Feature enables user to get information about country that he search for:

For better user experience, first letter is always transformed to "UpperCase" so that user does not have to remember about doing it. It makes filtering function 
working properly.
I also added Table Pagination to make it easier for user to compare Data and it looks better too.

User can also choose how many rows should be displayed in the table.
Sorting has been apllied in column's button headers and it allows user to sort data descending and ascending

At the top of the website, there are highlighted informations about country that has got most of new cases, new deaths and recent recoverations

By clicking on Country name in the widget, user is redirected to "google search" in new card so that he can get more information about country

Website is fully responsive and works on all kind of devices. Example shown on iPhone 12 Pro below:
