## Description & Screenshots

Application has been created with the help of modern web-development tools like React, SCSS, Typescript, and Material UI. Thanks to all of that it provides a great user 
experience, so that data can be seen clearly with the ability to sort and filter.
The project has two available themes: dark and light.
Light Mode (default):

Filtering Feature enables the user to get information about the country that he searches for:

For a better user experience, the first letter is always transformed to uppercase so the user does not have to remember to do it. It makes the filtering function 
working properly.
I also added Table Pagination to make it easier for users to compare Data and it looks better too.

Users can also choose how many rows should be displayed in the table.
Sorting has been applied in the column's button headers and it allows the user to sort data descending and ascending

At the top of the website, there are highlighted pieces of information about the country that has got most of the new cases, new deaths, and recent recoveries.

By clicking on the Country name in the widget, the user is redirected to "Google search" in the new card so that he can get more information about the country.

The website is fully responsive and works on all kinds of devices. The example shown on iPhone 12 Pro below:
